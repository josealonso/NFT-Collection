#### View the collection on Opensea

- Create a new file called `pages/api/[tokenId].js`

- Edit the file so that we have an api route which *Opensea* can call to retrieve the metadata for the NFT.

- Deploy a new NFT contract with this new api route as your *METADATA_URL*.

- After vercel has deployed your code, open up your website and mint an NFT.

- After your transaction gets successful, replace  *your-nft-contract-address* with the new address of your NFT contract.

- Go to (https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/your-nft-contract-address/1)

Your NFT is now available on Opensea ðŸš€ ðŸ¥³
